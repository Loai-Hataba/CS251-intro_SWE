Task Description : 


Task 1.1: System Architecture 
1-	Identify all the main components or subsystems of the system and describe their role.
2-	Decide the suitable architectural design for your application. 
3-	Draw an architectural diagram showing the different parts of the system using a suitable notation like C4 or arrow and box. 
Task 2.1: Class Diagram
1-	Identify all the important classes in the system in each component. 
2-	Divide these classes into packages or subsystems, each one includes the related classes.
3-	Decide the responsibility of each class and what role it plays.
4-	Design the attributes and operations of each class. For each attribute decide the type and visibility. For operations, decide the name, parameters and return type.
5-	Design the relations between classes (inheritance, association, aggregation, composition). For each relation, decide the direction and multiplicity and give it a label.
6-	Read again, the Software Design Specifications template given with this assignment. 
7-	Finally, draw a complete class diagram for the system, divided into packages or systems. Use a tool for drawing. 
Task 1.3: Sequence Diagrams 
Sequence diagrams help developers understand how a system works and how a use case is implemented using the classes and methods in the class diagram.
1-	Select the most important six user stories from your SRS or the sample SRS included 
2-	Implement a detailed sequence diagram for each one of them. 
3-	Read again, the Software Design Specifications template given with this assignment. 
Task 1.4: State Diagrams 
State diagrams help developers understand the different possible states for an important object and the events that cause it to move it from a state to another. 
For the one important object, draw a state diagram to show the developer the different states it can be in. 
Task 1.5: SOLID and Design Patterns 
Demonstrate how your design applies 3 of SOLID principles and uses 3 Design Patterns.
